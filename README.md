Experience from the project:
Angular was a challenge to work with at first, but once I understood the concepts of $scope, 2-way binding, the MVC model, and the differences between services and factories, I was able to conquer this project. At this point CSS is fairly easy and I can quickly create something based on a given design. The hard part was learning how to work in Angular.
Scope at first was a very difficult concept to grasp. However, the key moment happened when I realized that $scope is just a prebuilt object, I realized that I could work with it fairly easily and quickly.
Angular feels different that working in plain Javascript, but that's just because it has it's own rules and semantics. After finishing this project, it's clear as to who Angular would be a great MVC to work with on a large application.
